README.md
This repo is to hold drush.make files for platforms to support these web sites:

aerial-ny.library.cornell.edu
cuneiform.library.cornell.edu
engineering.library.cornell.edu
lts.library.cornell.edu
olinuris.library.cornell.edu
seanews.library.cornell.edu

This branch is no longer needed - the Southeast Asia Newspaper Archive (seanews) already had it's own git archive git@github.com:cul-it/seanews-library-cornell-edu.git so I'm starting to use that repo instead.
